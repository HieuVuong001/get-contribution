## Algorithms
The algorithm is very simple. It calculates the time spent in a repo based on the number of times people have pushed to it.

This time between "pushes" is the contribution time.

## Inspiration
This tool is not meant to be an *accurate* measure of contribution. Rather, it is meant to give people a rough sense of how much time they have spent on a project.
Folks who are applying to jobs might find this tool useful since it provides a useful **metric** to be put on resume.
